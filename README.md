Hello everyone. I'm a girl from Malaysia.
Malaysia is a rich and vibrant country filled with different ethnicity and culture living under the same roof.If you have not been to Malaysia, please do. Our food here will eventually blow your mind and you'll unintentionally begging for more. We speak multiple language and merge them into a sentences. Special isn't it? Let me demonstrate for you. If you would like to invite a  friend for lunch, Malaysian usually said this; "Eh macha(tamil), want to(english) makan(malay) mou(chinese)? This type of language used is what Malaysian called as Manglish.
